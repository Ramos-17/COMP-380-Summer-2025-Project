Project Summary:
  This is a web app for a small clinic to manage their appointments, treatments, and medical history. The system supports multiple roles, each with customized dashboards and functionalities specific for their responsibilities. Key Features include appointment scheduling and tracking, real-time treatment plan updates and documentation, access to patient medical history and care information.
  The backend will be built using python with the Flask framework and the frontend will be developed using React. MySQL will be the primary database for storing patient and storing clinic data. Code will be version controlled through GitHub.
